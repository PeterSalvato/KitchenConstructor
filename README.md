# KitchenConstructor

A modular recipe system built for flexibility, cognition, and creativity.

## Structure

- `!staging/`: in-progress recipes
- Format folders (Tacos, Pasta, etc.) contain:
  - Base recipes
  - Fillings
  - Sauces
  - Final builds

## Philosophy

- Modular, remixable, extensible
- Designed for GitHub, Obsidian, and human-first workflows
