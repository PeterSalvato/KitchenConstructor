Here's a revised version of your gluten-free pumpkin bread recipe, with a slight increase in both the pumpkin puree and oil to enhance moisture:

### Moist Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread (using canned pumpkin puree)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 ¼ cup (300g) canned pumpkin puree
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 130g brown sugar (adjust to taste)
- 5g salt
- 1 stick (113g) butter, browned
- 50g olive oil
- 200g King Arthur Measure for Measure GF flour

#### Optional Additions:
- 1–2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger)
- Chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top

#### Instructions:
1. **Preheat your oven** to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan.
2. **Brown the butter** in a small pan until golden brown and fragrant. Let it cool slightly.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the **pumpkin puree, eggs, vanilla extract, brown sugar, salt, olive oil**, and **browned butter**.
4. In another bowl, combine the **gluten-free flour**, **baking soda**, **baking powder**, and **pumpkin pie spice** (if using).
5. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Avoid overmixing.
6. **Pour the batter** into your prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.
7. **Bake** at 350°F for about **60 minutes**, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. Let the loaf cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.

### Revised Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread Recipe with Extra Egg and Psyllium Husk

#### Ingredients:

- **1 cup (240g) canned pumpkin puree**
- **3 eggs** (adding one more for richness and binding)
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **1 tsp baking soda**
- **1 tsp baking powder**
- **130g brown sugar** (adjust to taste)
- **5g salt**
- **1 stick (113g) butter, browned**
- **30g olive oil** (reduced from previous adjustment to balance moisture)
- **1–2 teaspoons psyllium husk powder** (for structure)
- **200g King Arthur Measure for Measure GF flour**

#### Optional Additions:

- **1–2 tsp pumpkin pie spice** (or a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger)
- **Chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top**

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven** to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan.
2. **Brown the butter** in a small pan until golden brown and nutty. Let it cool slightly.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the **pumpkin puree, eggs, vanilla extract, brown sugar, salt, olive oil**, and **browned butter**.
4. In another bowl, combine the **gluten-free flour**, **baking soda**, **baking powder**, **psyllium husk powder**, and **pumpkin pie spice** (if using).
5. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Don’t overmix. Allow the batter to rest for **5–10 minutes** so the psyllium husk can fully absorb the liquid.
6. **Pour the batter** into your prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.
7. **Bake** at 350°F for about **60 minutes**, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.

#### Why This Will Work:

- **Extra egg**: The third egg will add richness and more binding power, improving the overall texture.
- **Psyllium husk**: It will help bind the ingredients, improve elasticity, and provide more structure, keeping the bread from falling apart.

Letting the batter rest for a few minutes after mixing allows the psyllium husk to fully hydrate, which is key to getting the right consistency.

This should result in a richer, more stable, and moist loaf.
