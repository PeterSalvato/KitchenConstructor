Excellent — let’s lock in a **finalized modular gluten-free breakfast biscuit base**, a **flavor behavior chart**, and a few **initial flavor formulas** to get you baking and iterating confidently. I’ve blended the structure and science from _Modernist Cuisine_, _Gluten-Free Baking for Dummies_, and academic gluten-free food science sources to ensure it's both technically solid and practically versatile.

## 🥣 Instructions

1. **Preheat** oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
    
2. **Toast oats** (optional but highly recommended for flavor). Cool.
    
3. **Mix dry ingredients** in a large bowl.
    
4. **Whisk wet ingredients** separately.
    
5. **Combine wet + dry**, stir until incorporated. Dough should hold together and be slightly soft.
    
6. **Add mix-ins (from chart below)**. Mix gently.
    
7. **Scoop & shape** 2–3 Tbsp portions into discs ~½" thick.
    
8. **Chill** 15–30 min if time allows (for cleaner edges, better texture).
    
9. **Bake** 14–16 min until golden at edges.
    
10. **Cool fully** on a wire rack for crispness.

# 📊 Flavor Behavior Chart

|Group|Behavior|Key Adjustments|
|---|---|---|
|🍓 **Freeze-Dried Fruit**|Absorbs moisture, crisps well|No major change needed|
|🍫 **Cocoa / Chocolate**|Dries dough, needs more fat|Add 1–2 Tbsp extra fat/milk|
|🥜 **Nut/Seed Butters**|Heavy, softens texture|Reduce added fat slightly|
|🌿 **Spices / Citrus**|Low-moisture, flavor-focused|Add zest or spice freely|
|🍌 **Dried Fruit**|Chewy, can make dough sticky|Chop small, reduce liquid|

# 🧠 Why This Works

This recipe takes advantage of:

- **Gluten-free binding systems** (oat, flax, egg, and starches)
    
- A **dual-fat profile** (saturated fat for crispness, protein for chew)
    
- Scientifically supported crisp textures via low-moisture ingredients and proper bake/cool methods
