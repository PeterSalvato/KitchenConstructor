`12### Banana Bread Recipe
#### Ingredients:
- **2 eggs**
- **3 bananas** (roughly 350g), mashed
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **1 tsp baking soda**
- **1 tsp baking powder**
- **130g brown sugar**
- **1 stick (1/2 cup) brown butter**
- **30g olive oil**
- **200g King Arthur Measure-for-Measure gluten-free flour**

#### Directions:
1. **Preheat the oven**: Preheat your oven to **350°F (175°C)**.
2. **Brown the butter**: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and cook until it becomes golden brown and smells nutty. Set aside to cool slightly.
3. **Mash the bananas**: In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas until smooth.
4. **Mix wet ingredients**: In the same bowl, add the eggs, vanilla extract, brown sugar, brown butter, and olive oil to the mashed bananas. Mix until well combined.
5. **Add dry ingredients**: Stir in the baking soda, baking powder, and gluten-free flour until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
6. **Prepare the pan**: Grease a loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.
7. **Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake in the preheated oven for **1 hour**, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. **Cool**: Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.
