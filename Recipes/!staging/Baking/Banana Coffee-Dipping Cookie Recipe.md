If you want your banana cookies to have a **harder, crisper texture** for dipping in coffee, you'll need to make a few more adjustments to the recipe. Here’s how to achieve a firmer, crunchier cookie:

### Key Adjustments for a Harder Cookie:
1. **Reduce Moisture**: A drier dough will yield a crisper cookie. We’ll reduce the moisture further by cutting back on the bananas and making sure the other wet ingredients are balanced.
2. **Increase Flour**: Adding more flour will also help to firm up the dough.
3. **Decrease Leavening**: Less baking soda/powder will prevent too much puffing, which results in a softer cookie. We’ll focus on keeping the cookies flatter and crisper.
4. **Lower Temperature, Longer Bake**: Baking at a lower temperature for longer will help draw out moisture and make the cookies crunchier.

### Adjustments for a Harder Texture:
1. **Bananas**: Use **2 smaller bananas (about 200-220g total)**. This will reduce the moisture content further.
2. **Egg**: Use **1 egg** as before, but you can even try using just the **egg yolk** for an even drier dough.
3. **Olive Oil**: Eliminate the olive oil entirely. The butter should be enough fat, and cutting out the oil will help with the firmer texture.
4. **Increase the Flour**: Increase the flour to about **275g** to help achieve a drier, more structured dough.
5. **Leavening Agents**: Reduce the baking soda to **1/4 tsp** and the baking powder to **1/4 tsp**. This will limit rising and puffing, resulting in a crisper cookie.

### Cooking Technique:
- **Bake at a lower temperature**: Instead of baking at 375°F, bake the cookies at **325°F**. This slower bake will allow the moisture to evaporate and give you that desired crispy texture.
- **Longer baking time**: Bake for **18-20 minutes**. You want the cookies to be golden brown all over, not just at the edges. This extended baking time at a lower temperature helps dry them out and firm them up.

### Revised Banana Coffee-Dipping Cookie Recipe

- **1 egg yolk** (or 1 whole egg if you prefer)
- **2 small bananas** (about 200-220g) mashed
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **1/4 tsp baking soda**
- **1/4 tsp baking powder**
- **130g brown sugar**
- **1 stick (1/2 cup) brown butter**
- **275g King Arthur GF measure-for-measure flour**

### Directions:
1. **Brown the butter**: Brown the butter if you haven’t already. Allow it to cool slightly.
2. **Mash the bananas**: In a bowl, mash the bananas until smooth.
3. **Mix wet ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas, brown butter, egg yolk (or whole egg), vanilla extract, and brown sugar. Stir until combined.
4. **Add dry ingredients**: Mix in the baking soda, baking powder, and gluten-free flour until a firm dough forms.
5. **Chill the dough** (optional but recommended): If the dough is soft, chill it in the fridge for 30 minutes to make it easier to handle.
6. **Shape the cookies**: Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and flatten them slightly with the palm of your hand or the back of a spoon on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
7. **Bake**: Preheat the oven to **325°F**. Bake the cookies for **18-20 minutes** until golden brown all over. The cookies should be firm to the touch and not soft in the center.
8. **Cool**: Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack, as they will firm up even more as they cool.

### Extra Tips:
- If after baking the cookies are still not as crisp as you'd like, you can return them to the oven at **300°F for 5-10 more minutes** after they have cooled, similar to how biscotti is made. This will dry them out further and create a crunchier texture.
- You could also consider using **turbinado sugar** (raw sugar) or a mix of granulated sugar and brown sugar instead of just brown sugar to create a crisper exterior.

These adjustments should give you a much firmer, crisp cookie that holds up well for dipping in coffee, while still retaining that delicious banana and brown butter flavor! Enjoy the process and let me know how it turns out!
