The Thai quick pickle you describe is quite close to an authentic **Thai-style pickled salad**, often served as a refreshing side dish to balance out the rich flavors of curries or stir-fries. In Thai cuisine, this type of pickle is called **"Ajaad"** (pronounced a-jaht) and typically includes cucumbers, carrots, and sometimes shallots or chili peppers for a bit of heat. The pickling liquid usually contains a balance of sweet, sour, and salty flavors, which aligns well with your recipe.

### **Traditional Thai Quick Pickle (Ajaad)**

Here’s a slight adjustment to your recipe to make it even closer to the traditional Thai Ajaad, which often includes a touch of salt to balance the sweetness and acidity:

#### **Ingredients:**
- 1/3 cup white vinegar
- 1/3 cup water
- 1/3 cup white sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1–2 small cucumbers, thinly sliced
- 1 large carrot, julienned or thinly sliced
- 1–2 small shallots, thinly sliced (optional)
- 1–2 Thai bird’s eye chilies, thinly sliced (optional, for heat)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Make the pickling liquid:**
   - In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

2. **Prepare the vegetables:**
   - Thinly slice the cucumbers, carrots, shallots (if using), and chilies (if using).

3. **Pickle the vegetables:**
   - Place the sliced vegetables in a bowl or jar. Pour the cooled pickling liquid over the vegetables, ensuring they are fully submerged.

4. **Marinate:**
   - Let the vegetables sit in the pickling liquid for at least 15–20 minutes before serving, though they can be refrigerated for longer for more intense flavor.

5. **Serve:**
   - Serve as a side dish or garnish alongside Thai curries, grilled meats, or stir-fries.

### **Notes:**
- **Authenticity:** The touch of salt and optional shallots and chilies in this version bring it closer to traditional **Ajaad**. It's commonly served with satay or rich curries to cut through the richness with its sweet, sour, and slightly salty flavors.
- **Adjust to Taste:** You can adjust the sugar, vinegar, and salt balance to suit your personal taste. Some prefer a slightly more sour pickle, while others enjoy a sweeter one.

This Thai pickle is perfect for complementing dishes like **Massaman curry** or other Thai meals with its refreshing crunch and tangy flavor! Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments or serving suggestions.
