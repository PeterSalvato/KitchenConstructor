### **Chicken Satay Entrée with Peanut Sauce, Rice, and Cucumber Salad**

#### **Ingredients:**

**For the chicken and marinade:**
- 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into bite-sized strips
- 1/2 cup coconut milk (unsweetened)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

**For the peanut sauce:**
- 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
- 3/4 cup coconut milk (unsweetened)
- 1.5 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1.5 tablespoons lime juice
- 1.5 teaspoons red curry paste (or 1 teaspoon chili flakes, to taste)
- 1/3 to 1/2 cup water (to thin the sauce, adjust as needed)

**For the rice:**
- 2 cups jasmine rice or basmati rice
- 4 cups water or chicken broth (for extra flavor)
- Pinch of salt

**For the cucumber salad (optional, for freshness):**
- 1 cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar or lime juice
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: a sprinkle of sesame seeds or fresh cilantro

**For serving:**
- Fresh cilantro for garnish
- Lime wedges
- Toasted peanuts (optional, for extra crunch)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Marinate the chicken:**
   - In a bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, soy sauce, fish sauce (if using), brown sugar, curry powder, ground coriander, turmeric, garlic, lime juice, and vegetable oil.
   - Add the chicken strips and mix well to coat. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours, preferably overnight for the best flavor.

2. **Prepare the peanut sauce:**
   - In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the peanut butter, coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, and red curry paste (or chili flakes).
   - Gradually add water until the sauce reaches a thick but pourable consistency. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring until smooth and warmed through. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Set aside.

3. **Cook the rice:**
   - Rinse the rice under cold water to remove excess starch.
   - In a medium pot, combine the rice, water (or chicken broth), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 15-18 minutes, until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.

4. **Prepare the cucumber salad (optional):**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the rice vinegar (or lime juice), sugar, salt, and pepper. Toss the cucumber and red onion slices in the dressing.
   - Let it sit for 10-15 minutes to marinate and chill before serving. Garnish with sesame seeds or cilantro if desired.

5. **Grill the chicken:**
   - Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated chicken strips onto skewers.
   - Grill the chicken for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until fully cooked and slightly charred on the edges.

6. **Assemble and serve:**
   - Serve the grilled chicken satay over a bed of jasmine or basmati rice.
   - Drizzle the chicken with some peanut sauce and serve the rest of the sauce on the side.
   - Add the cucumber salad on the side for a refreshing contrast. Garnish with fresh cilantro, lime wedges, and toasted peanuts if desired.

### **Notes:**
- **Vegetable side option:** You can also serve this with a simple steamed or sautéed vegetable, like broccoli, green beans, or sautéed bok choy.
- **Satay without skewers:** For an easier version, you can skip the skewers and grill or pan-fry the marinated chicken pieces directly, cutting down on prep time.
