That dish you describe sounds like a version of *Yoğurtlu Tavuk Şiş* (yogurt-marinated chicken kebab with yogurt sauce), a traditional Turkish dish. The yogurt marinade tenderizes the chicken and adds a great depth of flavor, while the yogurt sauce and bread are typical accompaniments in Turkish cuisine. Here's a recipe inspired by what you had at Sahara:

### **Yogurt-Marinated Chicken Kebab (Yoğurtlu Tavuk Şiş)**

#### **Ingredients:**

**For the chicken and marinade:**
- 1.5 lbs chicken breast or thighs, cut into kebab-size cubes
- 1 cup plain full-fat yogurt (Greek or Turkish)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for spice)

**For grilling and serving:**
- Flatbreads (like Turkish *pide*, pita, or lavash)
- Melted butter or olive oil (for brushing bread)
- Chopped fresh parsley or sumac (for garnish)

**For the yogurt sauce:**
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 1 clove garlic, finely minced or grated
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: a pinch of dill or mint for extra flavor

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Marinate the chicken:**
   - In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, coriander, salt, pepper, and cayenne (if using). 
   - Add the chicken pieces and mix to coat thoroughly.
   - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. The yogurt will tenderize the chicken and infuse it with flavor.

2. **Prepare the yogurt sauce:**
   - While the chicken is marinating, prepare the yogurt sauce by combining yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Add herbs if desired. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

3. **Grill the chicken:**
   - Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes to prevent burning.
   - Thread the marinated chicken onto the skewers.
   - Grill the chicken for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until fully cooked and nicely charred in spots.

4. **Prepare the bread:**
   - Brush the flatbread with melted butter or olive oil. Toast it lightly on the grill or in a pan until warm and slightly crispy.

5. **Serve:**
   - Lay pieces of the grilled flatbread on a plate.
   - Place the grilled chicken skewers on top of the bread. Drizzle generously with the yogurt sauce.
   - Garnish with chopped parsley or a sprinkle of sumac for extra flavor.

#### **Notes:**
- The bread soaks up the juices from the chicken and yogurt sauce, adding an extra layer of deliciousness.
- For an authentic touch, you can also serve with a side of rice pilaf or a simple Turkish salad.

Enjoy your homemade Turkish *Yoğurtlu Tavuk Şiş*! This should give you a close approximation of the delicious dish you remember from Sahara.
