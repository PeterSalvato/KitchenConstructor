### **Italian-Style Meatballs Recipe (with 40g of Bread)**

#### **Ingredients:**

- **1 lb (450g) ground  pork**
- **1 lb (450g) ground beef**
- **2 large eggs**
- **40g of bread** (about 1.5 slices of standard white or wheat sandwich bread)
- **1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese** (optional, for added flavor)
- **2-3 cloves garlic, minced** (or 1 tsp garlic powder)
- **1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped** (or 2 tsp dried parsley)
- **1 tsp dried Italian seasoning** (or a mix of basil, oregano, and thyme)
- **1/4 to 1/2 cup milk** (for soaking the bread)
- **Salt and black pepper to taste** (about 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper to start)
- **Olive oil** (for browning the meatballs)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Soak the Bread:**
    
    - Tear the 40g of bread into small pieces and soak it in the milk (use just enough milk to soften the bread, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup).
    - Let it soak for a few minutes until the bread is soft, then squeeze out the excess milk so the bread is moist but not soggy.
2. **Mix the Meat:**
    
    - In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, ground beef, eggs, soaked bread, Parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper.
3. **Combine:**
    
    - Gently mix the ingredients together using your hands or a spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the meatballs tough.
4. **Form the Meatballs:**
    
    - Roll the meat mixture into meatballs about 1.5 inches in diameter. You should get around 20-24 meatballs.
5. **Brown the Meatballs:**
    
    - Heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
    - Add the meatballs in batches, browning them on all sides, about 7-8 minutes per batch. Remove the browned meatballs and set them aside.
6. **Cook in Sauce (Optional):**
    
    - If you're using a marinara or tomato sauce, transfer the browned meatballs into the simmering sauce and let them cook for an additional 20-30 minutes. This will allow them to absorb more flavor and finish cooking through.
7. **Serve:**
    
    - Serve your meatballs with pasta, on a sandwich, or on their own with a side of vegetables or salad.

### **Pro Tip:**

If you prefer to bake the meatballs instead of frying them, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C), place the meatballs on a lined baking sheet, and bake for about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Italian-style meatballs!
