Creamy No-Roux Mac & Cheese with Banza & Cheddar
Date: 2025-04-23

🛒 Ingredients (for 2 boxes of Banza elbow pasta - 16 oz total):
- 226g cheddar cheese, grated (~2 1/4 cups)
- 2–4 slices American cheese (for creaminess)
- 1 cup whole milk (or 3/4 cup milk + splash of cream)
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp cream cheese (optional but helps smoothness)
- Salt, to taste
- Optional: pinch of mustard powder, garlic powder, or paprika

🍳 Instructions:

1. Cook Pasta
   - Boil 2 boxes (16 oz) Banza elbows in well-salted water for 6–7 minutes (just under al dente).
   - Drain and briefly rinse with warm water.
   - Toss with 1 tbsp butter or a light drizzle of oil to keep loose.
   - Cover and set aside while you make the sauce.

2. Make Cheese Sauce
   - In a large skillet or pot, melt 2 tbsp butter over low heat.
   - Add 1 cup milk and warm gently (do not boil).
   - Stir in 1 tbsp cream cheese (if using) until melted and smooth.
   - Add grated cheddar a handful at a time, stirring constantly to melt.
   - Tear in 2–4 slices of American cheese and stir until the sauce is glossy and uniform.
   - Season to taste with salt and any optional spices.

3. Combine & Serve
   - Add cooked pasta to the cheese sauce.
   - Stir gently to coat.
   - Let it sit off-heat for 2–3 minutes to thicken slightly.
   - Serve warm.

👶 Tips:
- Use fewer American slices for more cheddar-forward flavor.
- Add a splash more milk if the sauce thickens too much while mixing.
- Keeps well if covered and gently reheated with a splash of milk.
