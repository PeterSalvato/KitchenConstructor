### **Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Prepare the Base for Both Versions**
1. **Prepare the vegetables:**  
   Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add a little oil, then add the chopped red onion and carrots. Sauté for 5–7 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots are soft.

2. **Cook the curry paste:**  
   Add the Thai yellow and green curry pastes to the pot. Stir well and cook for 2–3 minutes to release the flavors.

3. **Add liquids and coconut:**  
   Pour in 2 cups of chicken (or vegetable) broth and stir to combine. Dissolve the coconut milk powder into the broth.

4. **Add lentils:**  
   Add the rinsed red lentils and soy sauce. Stir well, then reduce the heat to low and let the lentils cook for about 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

#### **Version 1: Thick Stew Version with Rice**

1. **Thicken the curry:**  
   Continue cooking the lentils until they are soft and the curry has thickened to a stew-like consistency. The liquid should mostly be absorbed.

2. **Finish the stew:**  
   Once the lentils are fully cooked and thickened, remove from heat and stir in the lime juice and zest.

3. **Serve:**  
   Serve the thick curry stew over jasmine rice, garnished with fresh cilantro.

#### **Version 2: Thin Soup Version with Rice Noodles**

1. **Thin the curry:**  
   Once the lentils are cooked and soft, add 1–2 extra cups of broth to thin the mixture to a soup-like consistency. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.

2. **Prepare the rice noodles:**  
   While the soup is simmering, cook the rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

3. **Finish the soup:**  
   Stir in the lime juice and zest once the soup reaches the desired consistency. Adjust seasoning if necessary.

4. **Serve:**  
   Place the cooked rice noodles in bowls, ladle the soup over the noodles, and garnish with fresh cilantro.

### **Serving Suggestions:**

- **For the Stew Version:** Serve with steamed jasmine rice and a side of stir-fried veggies or a fresh salad.
- **For the Soup Version:** Add toppings like bean sprouts, fresh Thai basil, or sliced red chilies for extra texture and flavor. Serve with lime wedges for extra brightness.
