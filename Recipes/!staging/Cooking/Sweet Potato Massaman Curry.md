### **Homemade Massaman Curry Paste**

#### **Ingredients:**
- 4–6 dried red chilies (adjust for heat preference), deseeded and soaked in warm water
- 1 small red onion or 2 shallots, roughly chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1-inch piece fresh galangal (or ginger if unavailable), peeled and sliced
- 1 stalk lemongrass, tough outer layers removed, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 cardamom pods, seeds removed (or 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom)
- 2 whole cloves (or 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves)
- 1/2 teaspoon white peppercorns (or black peppercorns)
- 1 tablespoon shrimp paste (or 1 tablespoon soy sauce for a vegetarian version)
- Zest of 1 lime
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for blending)

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the dried chilies:**  
   Remove the seeds from the dried red chilies (if you want less heat) and soak them in warm water for about 10 minutes until softened. Drain and set aside.

2. **Toast the spices:**  
   In a dry skillet over medium heat, lightly toast the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cloves, and cardamom seeds until fragrant (1–2 minutes). Transfer to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind into a fine powder.

3. **Blend the aromatics:**  
   Add the soaked chilies, chopped onion/shallots, garlic, galangal (or ginger), lemongrass, and lime zest to a blender or food processor.

4. **Combine and blend:**  
   Add the ground spices, cinnamon, white pepper, shrimp paste (or soy sauce), and vegetable oil. Blend until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little water or oil to help blend, if needed.

5. **Store or use:**  
   Use immediately in the curry or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week. You can also freeze portions in ice cube trays for longer storage.

### **Sweet Potato Massaman Curry**

#### **Ingredients:**
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2–3 tablespoons homemade Massaman curry paste (from the recipe above)
- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk
- 1 cup vegetable broth (or chicken broth for non-vegetarian)
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon tamarind paste (or 1 tablespoon lime juice as a substitute)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari (for gluten-free)
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar (or palm sugar)
- 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2-3 cardamom pods
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 star anise (optional)
- 1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or coconut oil)
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
- Steamed jasmine rice (for serving)

#### **Optional Add-ins:**
- 1 cup chickpeas, drained and rinsed (for added protein)
- 1 large carrot, chopped (adds texture)
- 1 cup baby spinach (for some green)

---

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the aromatics:**  
   Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced red onion and sauté for 5–7 minutes until softened and slightly caramelized.

2. **Toast the spices and curry paste:**  
   Add 2–3 tablespoons of the homemade Massaman curry paste to the onions and stir. Cook for 2–3 minutes to release the flavors. Add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, bay leaf, and star anise (if using) to the pot, stirring for another minute.

3. **Add sweet potatoes and liquid:**  
   Add the cubed sweet potatoes and toss to coat with the curry paste. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable broth, stirring to combine.

4. **Season and simmer:**  
   Stir in the peanut butter, tamarind paste (or lime juice), soy sauce, and brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cover and let the curry simmer gently for 20–25 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.

5. **Optional: Add other vegetables or chickpeas:**  
   If you're adding chickpeas, carrots, or spinach, add them in the last 10–15 minutes of cooking.

6. **Finish and thicken the curry:**  
   Once the sweet potatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened slightly, taste and adjust seasoning if necessary (you may want more soy sauce, lime, or sugar).

7. **Serve:**  
   Remove the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and bay leaf before serving. Ladle the curry over steamed jasmine rice, and garnish with chopped peanuts and fresh cilantro.

### **Serving Suggestions:**
- **Rice:** Serve with jasmine or basmati rice to soak up the curry sauce.
- **Garnish:** Garnish with fresh lime wedges, extra chopped roasted peanuts, and cilantro.
- **Side Dish:** Pair with a Thai cucumber salad or a fresh papaya salad for a refreshing side.
