*This Chinese garlic sauce is lightly sweet and so flavorful. It’s amazing as a stir-fry sauce or it can be used as a dipping sauce.*

We love to make vegetable stir-fry with this sauce but it is amazing with beef and chicken. It can also serve as a dipping sauce for eggrolls!

## Chinese Garlic Sauce

One of the reasons we often order Chinese takeout is it’s just so darn flavorful.

The variety of sauces, spices, and heat levels are completely satisfying because there’s something to fit every mood.

While today’s Chinese garlic sauce is nothing short of flavorful, it is low on the heat. Feel free to add more chilis if you want it spicier.

Toss the sauce with your choice of vegetables and meat for a hearty stir-fry that can be served with rice.

The sauce is also great as a dip for fried dumplings!
