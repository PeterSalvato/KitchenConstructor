## @Aardvark-ed8jj

This is the best recipe i tried so far. Even though it appeared a bit difficult to make from first glance, I did not mess up anything and ended up with the best home made deep fried chicken so far. No idea if it's the marinade or double frying, but breast meat turned out juicy, not dry at all and best I've created until this day. Thank you for the recipe, I will try one of the pork recipes next time!

## @Hudson\_Brooks

I just wanted to say I gave this a go today and wow! Since moving to a small town in New Zealand it's been slim pickings to find a good Chinese restaurant or takeout. Much easier to find in our larger cities. I've been craving a good sweet and sour chicken and so gave this ago rather than cooking from a store bought sauce. I love it! Definitely room to improve but already the flavour is so much better than the pre made sauces. Great presentation of your Dad's knowledge and explanations along the way. Really appreciated. You've got a new fan!

## @Yohualli

This is the second recipe I tried from this channel, and I’m blown away. I love Chinese food, but the are not good Chinese restaurants in my town, so I’m trying to learn to make it myself. I love that the recipes are easy to follow, there are lots of tips and tricks, interesting info, and family stories. The food came out looking very authentic, and it was delicious. I couldn’t believe I was able to produce such a nice dish. I want to adopt daddy Lau as my Chinese grandpa who taught me how cook such tasty food. Thank you ☺️

## Sweet and Sour Chicken (甜酸雞)

  
This Sweet and Sour Chicken recipe is a twist on classic [Sweet and Sour Pork](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/sweet-sour-pork) that swaps out the protein for one that's leaner. It has the same great flavor and iconic sweet and sour sauce, perfect when you're craving the Chinese-American dish.

Today, my dad will show you how to make Sweet and Sour Chicken with the same wet batter technique that most restaurants use. It's a change from the dry batter he uses in his Sweet and Sour Pork, but yields the same crunchy, yet juicy nuggets of meat.

### What is the difference between General Tso's and sweet and sour chicken?

Chinese Sweet and Sour Chicken shares many similar characteristics as other famous [Chinese chicken recipes](https://www.madewithlau.com/collections/chicken-recipes), such as [General Tso's Chicken](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/general-tsos-chicken), [Orange Chicken](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/orange-chicken) and [Lemon Chicken](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/lemon-chicken). While they all feature crunchy, deep-fried chicken, there are slight nuances between each, mostly in the sauce. As its name suggests, Sweet and Sour Chicken sauce features a sticky, tangy sauce that gets its tartness from vinegar. General Tso's chicken has a slightly sweet, more umami flavor, along with a kick of heat from dried chili peppers. Orange and Lemon Chicken, on the other hand, get their signature taste from their respective citrus fruits.

### What to serve with sweet and sour chicken

[White rice](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/how-to-cook-rice) is always a good idea to serve alongside saucy dishes like this one, but you can also make a simpler fried rice, such as my dad's [Ginger Fried Rice](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/ginger-fried-rice) or [Egg Fried Rice](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/egg-fried-rice). Veggies are essential, too. Again, we recommend something that won't compete with the sweet and sour flavors, such as [Stir-Fried Bok Choy](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/stir-fried-bok-choy) or [Broccoli Stir Fry](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/broccoli-stir-fry).

### On ketchup

Ketchup is an essential ingredient for sweet and sour sauce and while most may consider it an all-American ingredient, its origins are actually Asian. As we've discussed in detail in our [Sweet and Sour Pork recipe](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/sweet-sour-pork), the condiment traces it origins back to 300 B.C. as a fermented fish sauce used in China. It has evolved over the years into the sweet, tomato-based sauce we know today and it's fascinating to see things come full circle, with ketchup used in many Chinese and Cantonese recipes, including [General Tso's Chicken](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/general-tsos-chicken), [Chinese BBQ Spare Ribs](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/chinese-bbq-spare-ribs) and [Tomato & Beef Pan-Fried Noodles](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/tomato-beef-pan-fried-noodles).

## Step 1: Prep vegetables

Cut the

pineapple

Stop wasting hours on tedious prep work - cut (hehe) prep time in half by mastering these 10 simple, universal cutting techniques.

## Step 2: Prep chicken

Cut the

chicken breast

**(12** **oz****)** into 1/2-inch thick slices. Cut in half lengthwise into strips, rotate and cut again into 1-inch chunks.

Place the chicken in a bowl and push the meat to one side. To the other side, add the

oyster sauce

**(1** **tablespoon****)**,

light soy sauce

**(1** **teaspoon****)**,

cornstarch

**(2** **tablespoon****)**,

water

**(1** **tablespoon****)** and

salt

**(1** **teaspoon****)**. Mix the marinade ingredients together first, then incorporate it with the chicken.

## Step 3: Prep batter

In a bowl, add the

flour

**(4** **tablespoon****)**,

cornstarch

**(2.5** **tablespoon****)** and

baking powder

**(1** **teaspoon****)**. Add the

water

**(7** **tablespoon****)** a bit at a time until you reach the desired consistency. Mix the batter until no lumps remain.

If it’s too watery, add more flour and cornstarch to thicken. You'll know you've reached the correct consistency when the stream of batter narrows as it falls off a spoon.

Add the

oil

**(1** **teaspoon****)** to batter and mix to thoroughly to combine.

## Step 4: Prep sauce

In a small bowl, mix together the

ketchup

**(5** **tablespoon****)**,

red vinegar

**(3** **tablespoon****)**,

rice vinegar

**(1** **tablespoon****)**,

salt

**(0.50** **teaspoon****)** and

sugar

**(4** **tablespoon****)** until fully combined.

Vinegar is a quintessential staple in the Chinese pantry. This course will teach you all about the different varieties, plus how to use them to add tartness and balance flavors in your favorite Cantonese dishes.

## Vinegar

Vinegar is a crucial ingredient in Cantonese cuisine, adding brightness, acidity, and depth to a wide range of dishes, but using it effectively requires an understanding of the different types and their unique flavor profiles. This lesson will introduce you to the essential vinegars used in Cantonese cooking, providing expert guidance on selection, storage, and cooking techniques to help you master the art of acidity in your dishes.

## Step 5: Prep slurry

In a small bowl, mix together the

potato starch

**(2** **teaspoon****)** and

water

**(2** **tablespoon****)** until thoroughly combined.

## Step 6: Fry chicken and veggies

Heat a wok on high, about 1 minute.

Add the

oil

**(10** **oz****)** and heat to 350°F. If it's getting too hot, lower the heat.

(**Chef's Tip:** You can also add more room temperature oil to quickly decrease the temperature.)

Pour the frying batter into the chicken and mix with chopsticks to thoroughly coat each piece.

Carefully add the chicken to the wok one piece at a time, making sure to drop them in as close to the oil as possile to prevent any oil splatters. Fry the chicken in batches so you don't overcrowd the wok.

If you previously lowered or turned off the heat to help the oil cool, increase it now to maintain a 350°F temperature. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes, moving the pieces around with chopsticks, until they start to turn golden on the outside. Set the first batch aside, scoop out any pieces of loose batter, and repeat until you've fried all of the chicken.

Heat the oil up to 380°F. Add the chicken for second fry, doing so in two batches. Fry for 30 seconds. Set the chicken aside and turn off the heat. Again, scoop out any pieces of loose batter so they don't burn.

Add the red bell peppers, onions and carrots into oil and fry for 30 seconds. Remove and set aside.

Pour out oil (or use again after filtering). Wipe off any excess oil from wok.

## Step 7: Cook sauce & finish dish

Add the sauce to the wok. Turn the heat to high.

When the sauce starts to boil, give it a stir with your wok spatula. Lower the heat to medium, then slowly add half of the slurry while continuing to mix.

Add the bell peppers, carrots and onions, continuing to stir to coat the vegetables. If needed, add the rest of slurry to reach desired consistency. Turn the heat off.

(**Chef's Tip:** Turning the heat off ensures that the chicken will stay nice and crispy.)

Add the chicken and mix to thoroughly coat. Add the pineapple and stir to mix.

Add a drizzle of finishing oil and mix it in.

Plate and serve immediately.
