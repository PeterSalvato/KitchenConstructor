### **Homemade Chocolate Pudding (Revised for Better Setting)**

#### **Ingredients**:

- 2 cups (500 ml) whole milk (or substitute with almond or oat milk for dairy-free)
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup (30 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- **4 tablespoons (30 g) cornstarch**Â (adjusted from 3 tablespoons for a firmer pudding)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (85 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or finely chopped chocolate
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Mix the Dry Ingredients**:
    
    - In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt until evenly combined.
2. **Add the Milk**:
    
    - Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to dissolve the dry ingredients and ensure no lumps remain.
3. **Cook the Mixture**:
    
    - Place the saucepan over medium heat. Stir continuously with a whisk or spoon as the mixture heats up.
    - After about 5-7 minutes, the mixture will thicken to a pudding-like consistency. It should coat the back of a spoon.
4. **Add the Chocolate and Flavoring**:
    
    - Reduce the heat to low and stir in the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate. Stir until completely melted and smooth.
    - Remove from heat and add the vanilla extract. Whisk well to combine.
5. **Cool and Serve**:
    
    - Pour the pudding into individual serving dishes or a single large bowl.
    - Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming.
    - Refrigerate for at least 2-4 hours or until completely chilled and set.
6. **Garnish and Enjoy**:
    
    - Top with your favorite garnishes: whipped cream, chocolate shavings, fresh fruit, or a dusting of cocoa powder.
    - Serve and enjoy your perfectly set chocolate pudding!

### **Tips**:

- The increased cornstarch ensures a firmer pudding, making it easier to slice or serve cleanly.
- If you prefer a softer, creamier pudding, reduce the cornstarch back to 3 tablespoons.
- Always whisk constantly during cooking to avoid clumps and achieve a smooth consistency.
